Welcome to Lila Sargent and Tovahn Vitol's Open Ended Project for Module 2

While the rules of this project are the same as the rules for the normal board game,
there are some key differences that should be noted:

When you need to interact with the board, such as during the set-up or placing newly
bought houses/cities/roads, an interactable board will pop up as a separate window
where you will be able to click where you want to place your structure.
This same mechanism will also occur if you need to move the robber.

Similarly, in terms of structures, each player gets assigned a color. You will
be able to tell your color after playing the first settlement during game set-up
so make sure to look out for that!

This game is also a multiplayer game, but only using one computer. Please make sure
to keep track whose turn it is (typically displayed via player name). Player names can
be the same, but it will work a lot better for you if they are not. Furthermore,
there are occasions where players will have to interact with the game while it is
not their turn, such as trading and getting robbed. For these actions, the player
will be prompted to preform them, so again, be sure to check the name of the player
being prompted to ensure the right person is taking action.

We hope you enjoy!
