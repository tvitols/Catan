# Catan

## By Lila Sargent & Tovahn Vitols

### **Summary**
Our program is an online version of the board Game Catan. Each player is working to
obtain Victory Points, with 10 being a win. To do this, they try to build Roads,
Settlements, Cities, and purchase Development Cards.

The board of Catan has 19 tiles, each having a resourceType. By placing a Building on
that tile, you gain access to that resource. Every time the Tile's key is rolled,
you will gain 1-2 of the corresponding resourceType. These resources are what you
will use to make purchases.

The game also has a Robber. Whenever a 7 is rolled, players who have 7 or more cards
will have to remove half of them (rounding down). Furthermore, the player who
rolled the 7 will get to move the Robber. By placing it on a Tile, that Tile is
unable to give resources to players, and you are able to steal one random resource
from the players on that new Tile.

You are also able to trade during the game. You can either trade with other players,
or with the bank, through the automatic 4:1 or a specific Trade you can obtain by
having a Building on a Port Vertex.

### **Future Work**
Something that we are very interested in doing for future Modules is both cleaning
up the graphics and gameplay, and also looking into some of the Catan expansions, such as Seafarers,
Cities and Knights, Traders and Barbarians, and Explorers and Pirates

### **Known Bugs**
If you X out of the Board graphics it ends the game.
Occasionally there's a random extra resource displayed in collectedResources
Note: Any additional bugs shown in Demo video have been fixed
